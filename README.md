Breakdown of the steps and components we would need to create:


## **Code quality manager need to have**

## **HTML Forms** :

* Sign-up Form
* Sign-in Form
* Reset Password Form
* Delete Account Form
* Update User Information Form
* Sign Out Functionality

## **JavaScript** :

* Client-side form validation using jQuery and regular expressions
* Handling form submissions using Ajax with jQuery
* Alert messages and modals for displaying messages to the user using jQuery UI or Bootstrap modals
* Time running using JavaScript's `Date` object or a library like Moment.js
* Redirects after successful actions using JavaScript's `window.location` or Ajax callbacks

## **PHP** :

* Server-side form validation to prevent SQL injection and ensure data integrity
* Database interactions using SQL queries with MySQLi or PDO in PHP
* Password hashing and validation using PHP's `password_hash()` and `password_verify()` functions
* Sessions management for user authentication and authorization in PHP
* Handling sign-up with Facebook, Google, and Apple ID accounts using OAuth libraries in PHP
* Saving sign-up passwords securely by hashing and salting passwords in PHP

## **SQL** :

* Creating and managing the `users` table with appropriate data types and constraints
* Storing user data securely by hashing passwords and avoiding storing sensitive information in plaintext

## **Bootstrap v5.3.3** :

* Styling the HTML forms and components for better user experience with Bootstrap classes and components

## **JSON** (Optional):

* Using JSON for data interchange between the client-side JavaScript and server-side PHP, especially for Ajax requests and responses
* Parsing JSON data received from the server and manipulating it dynamically on the client-side with JavaScript

## **NodeJS** (Optional):

* Using Node.js for server-side scripting instead of PHP, with frameworks like Express.js
* Handling form submissions and other server-side logic using Node.js
* Utilizing npm packages for tasks such as password hashing, session management, and OAuth authentication
* Integrating with MySQL or other databases for storing and retrieving user data
